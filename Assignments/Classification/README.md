## 🔹 KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors)  
- **Dataset**: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset  
- **Problem Statement**: Predict whether a tumor is **benign** or **malignant**.  
- **Steps Performed**:  
  - Data loading, inspection, and cleaning  
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations (heatmaps, histograms, correlations)  
  - Train-test split  
  - KNN model training with varying `k` values  
  - Hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal `k`  
  - Performance evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix)  
- **Result**: Achieved strong classification accuracy for breast cancer prediction.

## 🔹 SVM (Support Vector Machine)  
- **Dataset**: Mushroom Classification Dataset  
- **Problem Statement**: Predict whether a mushroom is **edible (e)** or **poisonous (p)**.  
- **Steps Performed**:  
  - Data exploration and preprocessing (encoding categorical features)  
  - Feature analysis and selection  
  - Applied Support Vector Machine (SVM) with different kernels (linear, RBF)  
  - Train-test split and model fitting  
  - Performance evaluation using accuracy score and classification report  
- **Result**: SVM classifier achieved high accuracy in correctly identifying edible vs poisonous mushrooms.

## 🔹 Naive Bayes
- **Dataset**: Adult Census Income Dataset 
- **Problem Statement**: Predict whether an individual's annual income exceeds 50K. 
- **Steps Performed**:  
  - Data loading, inspection, and preprocessing (LabelEncoder, dropping redundant columns)
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations (heatmap, count plot)
  - Naive Bayes (GaussianNB) model training
  - Performance evaluation (accuracy score)
  - Generating predictions on the test dataset
- **Result**: Achieved a solid accuracy for classifying individual income levels.
